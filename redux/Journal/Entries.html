                                <p>I feel like I lost somebody. 
I feel like I lost everybody. 
I have nothing anymore.

I don’t have people around me. I don’t have anything going on. I’m stressed out. I have no friends. We aren’t close. You got too close. I can’t do it. <br>
We aren’t even friends anymore. There was a line.

I feel like I lost you.

I feel like I can’t ever be close to anyone anymore.

I’m all alone this semester. Another 6 months. Stress. All alone in a school full of people I never look at. I go to class and never say a word. I go to work and never say a word. I join a call and never say a word. Why do I exist only to stay silent?

I have no money. My dad won’t help out the family. I guess I never really saw him much to begin with. I thought he cared. He’s going through something. Why didn’t he care? Why didn’t he fucking text me. Why does he think he can do this? He isolated himself. He did this to himself.

I’m doing the same? I’ve done the same. I am doing the same. Anything that happens I run away. I’ve been running away further and further ever since


I’m scared. I’m so fucking scared. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I thought we were close. I’m walking on eggshells finding the right words I can tell you without changing things. Because I know if I told you everything you would leave. I wanted it to be static. Maybe I didn’t. Maybe I welcomed change. I’m still engaged in it. I got what I wanted. You want more. I’m sorry for being this way. I don’t feel as close to you as i was before. Because now I can’t tell you anything. And it’s my fault.

I did like it. I do think about it. It’s wrong though. It’s so wrong. We’re friends. We were close. Not anymore. I crossed a line. I broke my own boundaries. I slipped away. I need to remain unchanged. Forever static.

I’m fake.

I’m too scared. I can’t do it. I already paid. Gone money. Broke. I have nothing. I waste so much money. I wasted so much time. I wasted too much. 

You don’t even know who I am.


I never talked to you either. No one in my family. I feel bad. It’s my fault too. Maybe I wasn’t meant to be here. I know this isn’t my life to live. After this last tape, what’s left to do? The MacBook files? Then what. What will happen then. The memories are preserved. But me? My value is lost. I’m not here for a reason. I honestly don’t have a reason to live.


I don’t wanna be here I look too ugly. I don’t look like a girl. I’ll never be a girl. I’ll never be happy. I’ll never be who I want to be. You’ll never see me as such. It’s just pretend. No matter the cost. I don’t have clothes. I don’t have the drive to learn makeup. I don’t have the courage to call Kaiser. I just take my meds. All I do. I could never do my eyebrows or get enough money to get laser. I’m static. I hate it. I want to change. You know I want to get better. But I can’t. I can say with 100% certainty, that my transition was a failure. And it was completely and totally my fault. I can’t even be kind to myself. Im a fuck up. I’m a fucking idiot. I can’t do anything. I should kill myself. I need to kill my self. I can’t do anything right. I don’t deserve to live. I was meant to kill my self.

I was meant to kill myself.

You look so pretty. I’m glad you could be happy. I’m glad you can be who you want to be. I’m envious. I’m so envious. And jealous. I want to be you. I want to be happy. There’s no joy for me. There’s no happiness left for me. I’m not here for myself. You are. You’re living your best life. The best you can. I’m not here for me. I’m here for my family. I’m here for my friends. But I don’t want to be here. I’m only here because I’m afraid of death. Isn’t that fucking sad? That the only reason why I’m still breathing is because I’m a fucking coward? I’m so scared

I’m so scared.

And I have no one to tell.

I have no one to rely on.

Because I’ve lost someone.
I lost somebody.
I’ve lost everyone.

                                <p>I don’t wanna die. 

I don’t want to leave this earth. The pain that death brings. The last feeling I will ever feel. Hurt. Just to escape. I would never get to feel relief. I will never get to feel happiness. I won’t feel anything. It’s endless. No resolution. 

But I have to die. I mean we all die someday. But I have to die. I have to kill myself.

It’s my only option. 

It’s the only thing I can do. I only hurt the people around me. My sickness hurts everyone I touch. Everyone I come into contact with. Every good person that surrounds me. They end up sick too. Even if it’s just a moment. A brief second in space where they met me, and they felt slightly worse. I make people’s day worse. I make their life slightly more annoying. I push my sadness onto my friends. My best friends. Who only want to see me do better. Who want to see me succeed. Who want me to feel happy too. And in return, I fill them with grief. 

I hurt the ones I love the most. 

It’s in my nature.

And I deserve to die for it.

I deserve it. I don’t want it. I am scared. So fucking scared. But I know if I continue living I will hurt you too. I will hurt everyone. I will hurt the people I love. You can’t stay near me. I will only hurt you. I will hurt you too.
</p>

                                <h1>Journal 8/14/24</h1>
                               <p>I can’t look at twitter. I can’t look at YouTube. I can’t look at instagram. I can’t look at other women. I can’t see videos of other women. I can’t listen to music. I can’t do anything. Everything reminds me of how much I’m not one of them. Every time I look in the mirror I’m reminded I’m not one of them. I’m playing pretend. I’m not even trying. I’m not a woman. I’m an asshole. I’m an idiot. I shouldn’t exist. I’m still a man. I look like a man. That’s all you will ever see from me. How can I even be a woman?

I feel like I fucked up somewhere. That at some point, some how, I fucked my whole life up. I felt like I always had depression. From the moment I could create conscious thought. But I have a perfect life. I’ve had nothing but happiness. And yet I still fucked it up. I should be so happy right now. I should be so so fucking happy. I am so grateful for what I’ve been given. For the people who are around me. Whether by choice or by obligation. They’re around me. And I still fuck it up. And I fucked it up constantly. I can’t be happy for some reason. I never was. Maybe for a moment. I should just die. I deserve to die. I don’t deserve any of this.

I don’t feel real. I don’t feel as though the person in these tapes is the same person I am today. I am so different. I understand that I’ve grown. I understand that’s how life works. And yet how come I still feel as though that isn’t me. That I am not the person you see me as. That this person I see before my very own eyes is not the same. I have grown, or maybe I was replaced. Whoever you are, that isn’t me.

I am cold.

I am a cold person. I used to be happy. Before I had a memory. And maybe a little thereafter. 

I see things that I have experienced. But I know that isn’t me. I know who I am. I am worthless. I am not meant to be that person. We are different. We are not the same. Maybe we swapped places. I hope that’s the case. Maybe you’re struggling too. I stole your home. I stole your happiness.

I’ll never get to know what it feels like. To be a woman. To be a girl. To have a child. To grow old. To be happy. To see you all mature. To see the world. I can’t do it. I got a taste of what life could be like. And I’m scared to progress. I’m scared to take another step. I want to be a woman. And I want to be me. I want to be happy. I want to be a girl. I want to love life. I want to experience it all. And yet here I am.

I don’t. I can’t. I never will.

It’s a curse. I did it to myself.

Maybe I threw it all away. Whatever I was. Whoever I would become. I was a kid. I was supposed to be a man. Maybe I’m not ready for it. I didn’t live up to your expectations. Maybe there weren’t any to begin with. 

Maybe I just want to be loved. I know I’m loved. Felt loved. I need to be felt. I need to feel. Or maybe I don’t. I don’t deeerve any of these things. I should die. I wish I was a girl. I wish I was happy. These aren’t the right words.

For some reason I thought you weren’t there for me, but you were, and maybe that makes it worse. Maybe that makes it all the more better. Maybe it shows how much of a problem I’ve become. How ungrateful I am for never being content. For never being happy. That the person I became is such a sad piece of shit. That I can’t do anything. That I can’t be anything. That all I do, all I ever do, is wish I were dead, and wish I could sleep forever, and cry, and wish I was a girl, and fail, and eat, and overeat, throw up, self harm, over and over again. I’ve wasted so much money trying to be a girl. I can’t be one. Because I don’t deserve happiness. You tried helping me. You tried making me see things differently. But I’m stuck in my ways. Intentionally not listening. You get mad. You get really really mad. You’re not wrong. You need to leave me. Like everyone else did.

<div class="post"><h1>Journal 8/13/24</h1><p>This was the first time I felt nothing on my birthday. It didn’t feel like my birthday. It didn’t feel like it was special. It was just another day like every other day. I feel so sad. I feel so, so very sad. I can’t live up to any expectations I have of myself. I can’t do anything, I’m so sad. I felt nothing. I want to feel happy. I want to feel loved.  But I can’t. You say happy birthday. I don’t feel special. I don’t feel anything. I just want to die. I want it all to end.

I’m supposed to feel special. I’m supposed to feel happy. I do want the attention. I wanted to hang out with my friends. I was too scared to even do it. I was too scared to do what I wanted to do. I can’t do anything right. I can’t seem to do anything right. I can’t be happy. I wanted something and I couldn’t be happy. Nothing is special anymore. I’m an adult, how could it be special? Why am I here, why do I exist. Why am I still here.

I guess I don’t really have a reason to exist after this. I was never living for myself. There’s nothing here for me. Who cares how much I’ve done. I know I’ve made some progress. But I simply don’t have a future. I don’t have a path I want to pursue. And I was meant to kill myself. That’s what I was put on this planet for. I’ve known it my whole life pretty much. It’s the only way out for someone like me. There’s nothing holding me here anymore.

You didn’t like me. That’s okay. We had some fun I think. I was happy for a bit. But I know we can’t be together. So I just have to get over it. And yet I see others living out my dream. I guess I just wanted to be loved. Not in the way you “love” me. If you even did love me. But you see me as a friend. Nothing more nothing less.

I’ve been archiving. I spend money. I pick up hormones. It’s all over. Nothing is left. I paid for this semester. I can’t get it back. What a sick joke. Letting go over thousands of dollars. My dollars. Just to kill myself. It’s what I need to do.

<div class="post"><h1>Suicidal thoughts 6/20/24</h1><p>I don’t know why I’m like this. I don’t know how I got to this point. I don’t know why I always end up right here. At the same moment. Repeating the same thoughts and actions. Redoing the same day. I’m broken. I can’t be fixed. And there’s only one solution. And I can’t do it.im not really suicidal
</p></div>  
<div class="post"><h1>I don’t know what to do 6/13/24</h1><p>I don’t know what to do, I have no one to go to, and it’s a very specific problem

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I am just fake or something. I don’t know. It feels like I don’t know. I have no one to help me. I don’t know what I’m doing right what I’m doing wrong I don’t know what I can do my situation. I’m completely totally lost.

I’m a girl obviously I don’t look like a girl and I don’t know how to improve. These are words that I don’t even know how to speak. I don’t even know how to translate in my brain into words plays. It makes no sense to it running itself in circles And I can’t take it anymore. Hold my hand. No one can tell me what I am doing right and what I’m doing wrong and what I need to do I am totally lost. I have no one I have no one. I’m so sad. I’m so sad. I feel like night every single day, so much I look up thoughts that I have because I have no one else to go to search and search for other people who have the same face solution can’t accept I can’t. I know that I’m a girl. It’s something I’ve always wanted. I’ve wanted this my whole personality my life, it’s the only reason why I’m alive. I’m still on my friend. See me as a guy because I’m not trying. I’m not trying.










No one fucking gets it. No one gets my thoughts.

I don’t feel valid

</p></div>  
<div class="post"><h1>Tears 5/25/24</h1><p>My tears feel warm
Every time we talk it’s like an intervention
My self esteem hit an all time low
Kept me mad evasive
I can assure I wasn’t in control


Yeah and we never spoke
Breath the same breaths, spoke some few tones
I wasn’t different then
I mean maybe I was just a little bit 
Still can’t justify it
Wanted to not exist back then too
Just knew it as a different thought
Some good days spelt bad news
Couldn’t explain my own feelings, I just lived through em
Not a day passed since we last spoke
I could tell you’re trying but promise its not your fault
Been years since I said a word
Been years since I closed the doors
Maybe I had dreams then…
We’re two sides in the same house
Just walls in between them
I just get frustrated, every sentence’s like my last chance
Dissecting words in the past tense
I think too much for the few I had left 
And I can never explain how I truly felt
How I truly feel
I’m not normal
I couldn’t be a normal human, we couldn’t be connected
Giving past potential, regrets built like an arm and a leg
I run away and leave your mind behind 
Come back like nothing happened
I left you on read for my own satisfaction



And I’m sorry we don’t talk much
I’m sorry I can’t be someone who peaks normally to you as a sister or a brother
Im sorry I shut you out for years it’s become who I am
My personality is not being connected, I’m not your child
I’m not what you wanted
I wish I could speak to you. I wish you knew how I felt

I honestly just wish I could tell you things. I wish I could be normal and have a connection with you guys. It’s just never something we did. I don’t think I ever got close to any of my family. It never feels like I’m apart of something. It never even feels like I’m a human. I just turn my brain off and stop talking. I have nothing to add to the conversation. I’m just there. I’m just a second thought. We never talked. I felt neglected. I feel neglected. I don’t know I feel like I’m doing everything wrong. Should families be like this.

I feel like a stranger in my own home
I know nothing about you guys
You guys know nothing about me
We never talked like that
We never talked at all
Why should I care
Was I emotionally neglected
Why do I always feel like an after thought
Why do I always feel like no one cares about me
Why does everyone hate me
I hate myself
I hate myself
I should kill myself
I’m such a piece of shit
I’m such a fuck up
I keep fucking everything up
I can’t do anything right
Why can’t I do anything right
I’m such a piece of shit
I hate you
I didn’t feel loved so I internalized as self hate

</p></div>  
<div class="post"><h1>Journal entry 5/22/24</h1><p>It won’t matter after today. I’ll go to sleep, wake up, continue existing. I’ll bide my time until I swallow all the pills I have left and let my body fall asleep forever. It’s what I deserve

Some thoughts not really related to that dark text above (lol so morbid)

Why the fuck what the fuck happened. I don’t know why I act this way to you guys. Idk I was mad but like obviously I got too into it and idk whatever I felt stupid and I felt bad so I left. I can’t handle confrontation I guess. Like yeah I’ve been negative this whole time. Yeah I’ve been depressed and it makes it hard for me to reach out and be at my 100%. I fucking run away and ruin every friend group I’ve ever had because of it. Because that’s just who I fucking am I guess. I’m just a piece of shit. And I’m sorry that I tried, I’m sorry that I exist. I don’t want pity. I don’t want to manipulate you guys for how you see me or how I portray myself. I’m fucking gone. The person you thought you knew wasn’t me. You got to know someone else at a better time. So yeah I guess I’ll just be another story you tell to other friends you make along the way like you do whenever you mention yash in passing. I’m just gonna be whatever you say I am. Because that’s all I’ve really been up to this point. A stone fucking wall. Styrofoam. I’m just nothing. I haven’t had a personality. I’ve just been busy. Things changed, I’m not as happy as I was before. Things aren’t good. Now I’m here. I’m gonna kill myself on Thursday (today). I don’t give a fuck about my legacy. I don’t give a fuck about what I leave behind. You know me. You know what I really am. This is me. Depressed and fucking annoying.

I mean you left too. What the fuck was I supposed to do. I run away. It’s in my blood. I can’t even talk to my family. I don’t even exist with my family. I’ve always felt like a ghost. Every family dinner or outing I just go nonverbal. What the fuck am I even there for. I’m just an extra head. This is the real me, nothing. I’m nothing. No personality. I’m whatever you say I am. I can be anything you want me to be, because I don’t do anything.
Maybe the says how it was in the beginning. Maybe that’s something I kept since I was a child. I gave up back then. I can’t talk. I can’t talk at work. I’m whatever you say I am. I can’t be trans. I can’t be a girl. I’m just gonna die a fucking man. Probably buried in a suit. I fucking hate to is shit. I just want to be anything but here right now. I can’t navigate this. I have no one. I’ve had no connection to anyone. I don’t know where I’m going. I’m sick of chasing answers that don’t exist. I hate how I can’t be anything but depressed. I hate always crying. I hate how I’ve been taking estrogen and I still can’t fucking be a girl. I’m just here. It’s better if I kill myself

I was meant to kill myself. It’s been my destiny since I was a kid. I’ve been meaning to do it for a long long time. I got over it and then it came right back. around the time I finally decided to be honest about my feelings. Explore myself and really try and start transitioning. Maybe it was the stress of getting a job, or maybe it’s the stesss of graduating high school. All I know is that ever since then it’s been festering and getting worse. No one can help me. You only care if I’m funny or can make you slightly happier. I stopped providing that for you. I’m sorry.

I feel nothing now. I just want everything to end. I don’t want to worry about it. My depression won.
</p></div>  
<div class="post"><h1>Journal entry 3/16/24</h1><p>I just don’t know how to feel or what to do. Even just existing isn’t enough. I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like I bring everyone down. All I do is hop on discord and even that’s not enough. I’m not enough. I can’t force myself to do anything. I’m not the person you think I am or want to be. I know you all mean well, but I think I deserve this. I think you should all move on from me. I’m not worth it, I never was. You guys are doing great without me. I’m just here, and that’s not enough at all. I can’t be happy, I can’t bring you guys happiness. 

Everyone did hate me back then. I don’t know how to describe it. But I lived it. Every day was so fucking hard. I was going to a place where nobody knew me, and everyone hated me. Or at least they were annoyed. I hated myself. The teachers didn’t like me. They said so themselves. All I did there was shut up and not talk. Because every time I opened my mouth I was doing something wrong. That’s why I hated that place. It reminded me of how much I hated myself. They didn’t like me. I know it. It’s the way they acted. It’s the way they talked to me. They didn’t like me. I don’t really care either way, I mean it’s all in the past. It’s not like people from high school can see me now. They’re just kids. Idk. I just wanted to kill myself back then, or transition, or both.

I just can’t be here. With you guys. I keep making you guys angry. I can’t be someone that makes you happy. I deserve to be killed. I deserve to kill myself anyways. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t fucking matter. I should kill myself. I know it. I need to kill myself. 

I just don’t know anymore. I’m sorry for ending up like this. A fucking wreck. A piece of shit. No one will know me. My family won’t get to know me. I’ve never talked to them once. Never talk to my parents, never really talked to my siblings. I’ve just always been alone. All I had were you guys. And I really do see you guys as my family. But I’m hurting you. I always do this. This always happens.. every single friend group I’ve always ended up being too depressed for them and then I drove them away. The same will happen. I’m sorry. I can’t be around you guys anymore. I’m gonna kill myself on Monday. I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to continue this cycle. 

All I’m doing is hurting the people I love.

Every time I open my mouth, every time I talk to anyone, I’m just fucking everything up. I don’t deserve anything good. I don’t deserve to live tonight. I don’t deserve to have anything. I want to kill myself so fucking badly. I want to die. I fuck everything up. I hurt you. I only hurt people. I’m the worst person to ever live. I’m horrible. I’m fucking horrible. I hate myself so much. I wish I just fucking died.
</p></div>  
<div class="post"><h1>Read this if I killed myself 3/7/24</h1><p>I didn't expect to make it this far. To be in a position where my future was so close. To be in a position where my decisions ultimately matter. Where my success is entirely dictated on the actions of my current self. Any and all dreams I had previously were never realized. I thought so hard of the idea of where I would like to be. And yet I still couldn’t figure out my “Passion.” I mean I found the things I love, but they don’t particularly represent where I’m ‘Supposed’ to go. If what I wanted was something I could have, then I wouldn’t be here right now. I’m not confused. I’m just dealing with the repercussions of my own actions. Of my own continual effort to make my hard ultimately harder. Because I really do hate myself. And yet here I am. 

I’m not looking for answers, and I’m not looking for the spark that will set me towards caring about myself either. I’m looking for a way out. I’m hoping that one day, my thoughts, my mind, and my person feel so bad that I finally have the strength to end it all.

Because I genuinly belive that I was made to kill myself

I never had a plan, an actually verifiable, actionable plan. I never thought I would live past 17. It was a fact. I was going through life every single day expecting me to kill myself. And yet when the date passed I couldn’t do it. I think I just cried in my bed. Another year. After that the goal post was moved. There was no way I could live another year? Or a year after that? And now I am here. Still breathing. Everyone else has the motivation to get to the next “goal” in their life. Everyone around me is praising me for taking advantage of the time I have right now. Yet all I do every day is to make it to the end. I assume every single day could be my last. It genuinely feels that way. There is nothing in my future. All I see is a blank abyss. Just nothing. I’m supposed to want something. I’m supposed to be something. It’s not the expectations of others, it's the expectation of life itself. 

For some reason I care about how I look socially. And how poor my life if I continued would be if I continued to live while not caring. If I continued living every single day, my life wouldn’t amount to anything. It would amount the same if I had not done anything at all. Which is what I am doing right now. It’s what i've been doing. It’s what i'll continue to do. Because it’s not what I want. It’s never been what I want or what I wanted. It’s always been about “you.” The idea of who “you” are in comparison to society or your peers. The kind of person that “you” can be. Who will you be in 10 years? What job will you have? Will you be in a relationship? Are you happy?

It’s not like I don’t think about these things, It’s just that my answers are rather morbid. Where most people would have a vague idea of their dreams and passion, I see nothing. I honestly hope within the next year I have the strength to end my life. Because that’s always been my goal. That’s been my one true answer all along. I never had an answer to any of those questions. The only answers I could give is that “I dont know.” Because I didn’t know. Because I knew deep down that I didn’t want to know anything. I didn’t want to think about my future because I know there's nothing for me there. 

I don't know. I guess I thought this would help. A person came to my class today and talked about all of the things I need to do to be successful in my field. “Marketing.” As a job. As a career. Networking between person to person. Interviewing. It’s just bullshit. I don’t want a job. I don’t want to be alive. I don’t want to pretend to want to be somewhere that I’m not. How can I give a shit about school or my job when I don’t even care about living? It’s always been like this. I was meant to kill myself. That is my destiny. I’ve been thinking about this since I was 5. I was meant to do it. Why can’t I just do it. Why don’t I have the strength to do it? Why am I scared? I need to do it. I need to actually just fucking do it. I can’t live like this anymore. What am I even doing?

There's no point to any of this. I should end it. Nothing good anymore. What is the point? I deserve it. I deserve it all. You get what you put in. I give up. I’ve given up since the beginning. Low self esteem, zero self confidence, self hatred, it's all over. I can’t be a woman, I can't be myself, I can't even give myself a new name. I can't do anything. There's no point. I should just end it.

I didn’t want to be born. I mean I really enjoy a lot of things ,but its not like I can enjoy them forever. Things end, that's why good things feel so good. But to get to the good you have to live in the bad. That sounded very stupid. But I don’t know. I feel like a zombie. Doing things because I have to, not because I want to. The “Responsibilities” that were placed on me now that I am an adult have no meaning to me. There’s no point to it. There's nothing for me here. I don’t care for it. I don’t care for my future and I certainly don’t care for it right now.

I thought the talk was really good though. I think that it was very enlightening seeing how a real person navigates life. He really made his own career. I always admired people who could do that. Especially artists. I couldn't do that. I’m going to school to become a marketer. How fun. I hate it. I hate being here. I hate putting on a fake smile. I hate having to be normal around my friends. I hate just existing. I don’t want to do it anymore. Why can't I have the strength to do it? Why cant I just fucking do it already.

<div class="post"><h1>If I died 1/12/24</h1><p>If I died tomorrow, I think I would’ve deserved it. I had it coming. If I died tomorrow all the people I cared about, all the people I’ve been holding back, will finally be free. My family wouldn’t have to feed an extra head. No more wasted time or resources to keep me going. They wouldn’t have to worry about connecting with their child who never seemed to want to connect. If I died tomorrow I think they’d be happier. I think everyone I touched would be happier. It’s just a fact. An objective fact. I don’t deserve to live. I don’t deserve to be here. I have so much privilege. I don’t deserve love. Not from anyone. Especially not from myself. I don’t deserve to get better. I deserve to rot. I deserve to rot until I have the strength to kill myself. I’m nothing.

I stopped feeling everything recently. A lack of feeling. Whiteness. Before I had an emptiness, one that I thought could be filled. I distracted myself, got lost into work, moments of inspiration that quickly died out. Now I feel nothing. I can’t think clearly anymore. I’m not in control of my life. I’m not in control of what happens. I’m just here.

I’m not you. I can’t tell you anything. I can’t tell you how I feel. I can’t tell you what I’m doing right or wrong. I can’t tell you that I’ve been feeling this way. I barely know you. We exchanged two conversations. I exchanged a few with you too. I can’t tell you what I’m going through. You’re too perfect. You wore it on your sleeve. You know exactly what you needed to get done. I didn’t have the heart to do the same. I’m not that talkative

I’m torn. I want to live. But I don’t deserve to. I’m heartless. I’m scum. I don’t deserve any of this. I deserve to be killed. I’m a waste of space. I’m sorry

I’m sorry

I think I want to kill myself. Part of me does. Part of me doesn’t want to think about it. So that’s why I think I feel nothing. Because feeling something right now would make me want to kill myself. But I feel nothing. Therefore I’m safe.

I need to be cut. I need pain. I need a reminder. To not fuck up.

I fucked I’m again today

I should’ve been closer to my family. I should’ve learned how to be friends with them. They loved me. They’ll never know me now. If they died tomorrow I would too. 

I can’t kill myself

My dad might do it too. I’m really worried for his health. We were never that close. Maybe me wanting to get close started fading away when you did too. You’re such a great person, and I know that. And I know you’ve given up so much for this family. Because you love us. And I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know what’s going on between the two of you. All I know is that you don’t have to kill yourself over this family. Because I know you hate yourself too. I don’t know why. But you shouldn’t. Because you’re the reason why we’re all here. I just want to see you better. You’re suffering every day because of us. I want to see you happy. I want to see you love yourself.

Ironic

I can’t see that for me. The difference is that I’m me. I know myself. I’ve done nothing but take. I take everything. I take from my friends. My family. I’m negative. I take all the fun. I’m nothing.

My brother would probably be crushed. He seemed so different. Since his friend did the same. I felt so sorry. I couldn’t console you then. I still can’t now. I couldn’t console my father today. He was crying. I couldn’t say a word. I don’t know how to express myself. I’m sorry dad. I really do love you. 

He wouldn’t like it. Another person taking their life. It wasn’t your fault. I can’t do it. I still want to. Part of me wants it.

I know that I probably will kill myself someday
It’s just a fact that I’ve been living by
That one day
I’ll have the strength to do it

It’s inevitable

I think everyone else would be able to move on eventually. It’s not like we all talked. It’ll be hard but you’ll be happier in the long run. Out of sight out of mind. I’m basically already dead. Its not like im doing anything right now. I’m just here. Consuming content. Eating. Gaining weight. Losing. Starving. Throwing up. Cutting. Sleeping. Playing games. I’m just here. Uncontrollable. I deserve it. I’m hideous.

Stop negative self talk. That’s all I do. That’s my personality.

I don’t want to see [] sad. He’d probably be sad. You’re my everything. You and []. [] and even []. I don’t know. It’s hard to name people close to me. I think by far you and [] are the closest. You’re my family. Your the reason I’m here. You’re the reason I keep waking up tomorrow. As sick as that sounds. I’m selfish. I’m a loser. I’m a piece of shit. I’m a failure of a human being. Who got blessed with such great friends. I met you. And you changed my life. And I finally feel something. And im sorry. 

I’m really sorry. You’re my everything. And I’m sorry.
