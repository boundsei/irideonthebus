                                <p>Some people get to see the sun twice, others aren’t so lucky. What are the chances that us as human organisms evolved in such a capacity to create two eyes? For depth of field? Chemelons use them independently but why do our eyes work the way they do? Flipping images upside-down and retina connections, why do our eyes work like this? Was it my ancestors choice to live like this? Do my ancestors scaff at how I fail to live up to my previous generations?</p>
                                <p>What does it mean to be human? I act a certain way with certain people but it’s not like a chose to be that way, I feel as though I acted out of necessity and decided not to change. My personality hasn’t changed since I was 13, many say I look and sound the same since I was 13. I knew different people back then and I knew less stuff back then, so why do I actthe same? I feel backed into a corner, like I made my bed and now I have to lay in it. Putting on a show constantly for the next person to view. Do they notice me? Am I noticed? Will they hear me out when I want to speak? What does it mean to be human? I find situations to be weird, conversations to be hard, emotions to make no sense. I still act the way I do, which bugs me a lot. How am I the same as Me, and why can’t We stop hating Myself? It’s stupid, this feels stupid and yet I’m doing this as some kind of therapy. Some kind of last cause or caution to the wind. I doubt this will be read nor will it be compartmentalized. I feel like one might skim and miss the margin and overthink its value. Is that what it means to be Human? To overthink everything until you break down? Do humans break down? I feel like robots know what they’re doing and maybe I feel like a broken robot, or maybe because I’m broken I’m human. Maybe life is a simulation. Maybe life really has no meaning. I believe in GOD though. Everything happens for a reason supposedly, but that goes without saying. Things will happen because something or someone made them happen. I’m here now because something happened and now I’m here. Something happened and now you dare reading this. It’s not a chapter, nor is it a journal or book. It is simply human. Do I capitalize human?</p>
